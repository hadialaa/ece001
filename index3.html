    <p>AI is relevant to any intellectual task.[192] Modern artificial intelligence
      techniques are pervasive[193] and are too numerous to list here. Frequently,
      when a technique reaches mainstream use, it is no longer considered artificial
      intelligence; this phenomenon is described as the AI effect.[194] High-profile
      examples of AI include autonomous vehicles (such as drones and self-driving
      cars), medical diagnosis, creating art (such as poetry), proving mathematical
      theorems, playing games (such as Chess or Go), search engines (such as Google
      Search), online assistants (such as Siri), image recognition in photographs,
      spam filtering, predicting flight delays,[195] prediction of judicial decisions,[196]
      targeting online advertisements, [192][197][198] and energy storage[199]
      With social media sites overtaking TV as a source for news for young people
      and news organizations increasingly reliant on social media platforms for
      generating distribution,[200] major publishers now use artificial intelligence
      (AI) technology to post stories more effectively and generate higher volumes
      of traffic</p>
