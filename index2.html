      <body>Thought-capable artificial beings appeared as storytelling devices in antiquity,[37]
        and have been common in fiction, as in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein or Karel
        Čapek's R.U.R.[38] These characters and their fates raised many of the
        same issues now discussed in the ethics of artificial intelligence.[32]
        The study of mechanical or "formal" reasoning began with philosophers and
        mathematicians in antiquity. The study of mathematical logic led directly
        to Alan Turing's theory of computation, which suggested that a machine,
        by shuffling symbols as simple as "0" and "1", could simulate any conceivable
        act of mathematical deduction. This insight, that digital computers can
        simulate any process of formal reasoning, is known as the Church–Turing
        thesis.[39] Along with concurrent discoveries in neurobiology, information
        theory and cybernetics, this led researchers to consider the possibility
        of building an electronic brain. Turing proposed changing the question
        from whether a machine was intelligent, to "whether or not it is possible
        for machinery to show intelligent
