    </center>
    <p>The long-term economic effects of AI are uncertain. A survey of economists
      showed disagreement about whether the increasing use of robots and AI will
      cause a substantial increase in long-term unemployment, but they generally
      agree that it could be a net benefit, if productivity gains are redistributed.[239]
      A 2017 study by PricewaterhouseCoopers sees the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China
      gaining economically the most out of AI with 26,1% of GDP until 2030.[240]
      A February 2020 European Union white paper on artificial intelligence advocated
      for artificial intelligence for economic benefits, including "improving healthcare
      (e.g. making diagnosis more precise, enabling better prevention of diseases),
      increasing the efficiency of farming, contributing to climate change mitigation
      and adaptation, [and] improving the efficiency of production systems through
      predictive maintenance", while acknowledging potential risks.</p>
