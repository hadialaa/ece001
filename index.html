    <h2>artificial intellgience </h2>
    <p>is intelligence demonstrated by machines, unlike the natural intelligence displayed
      by humans and animals, which involves consciousness and emotionality. The
      distinction between the former and the latter categories is often revealed
      by the acronym chosen. 'Strong' AI is usually labelled as artificial general
      intelligence (AGI) while attempts to emulate 'natural' intelligence have
      been called artificial biological intelligence (ABI). Leading AI textbooks
      define the field as the study of "intelligent agents": any device that perceives
      its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of achieving its
      goals.[3] Colloquially, the term "artificial intelligence" is often used
      to describe machines that mimic "cognitive" functions that humans associate
      with the human mind, such as "learning" and "problem solving<p>
    <h2>history of artificial intellgience </h2>
    <p>Thought-capable artificial beings appeared as storytelling devices in antiquity,[37]
      and have been common in fiction, as in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein or Karel
      ÄŒapek's R.U.R.[38] These characters and their fates raised many of the same
      issues now discussed in the ethics of artificial intelligence</p>
